#GitDemo

#Made a git account; downloaded VSCode and Python to Laptop to use and follow along. 
#Going to write some code in 100 days of Pythin and push to my GitHub account
#This is going to be fun

#GODDAMN that was annoying. Hahah. Just have to make sure the right steps are followed. Git -bash now active in Terminal.
##Moving on##
#Pulled down the Repo from git using 'git clone [URL]'. can check status of things with 'git status'
#need to add origin and master to push command
